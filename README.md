# Heart Rate Prediction Using Neural Networks
This project aims to predict heart rate using neural network models trained on physiological data, such as ECG signals or sensor readings. By utilizing deep learning techniques, the model captures intricate patterns in the data, providing real-time and accurate heart rate predictions. The neural network is optimized using Mean Squared Error (MSE) to minimize prediction errors and enhance model performance. This approach can be applied in various fields, including wearable health devices, fitness trackers, and telemedicine, to monitor cardiovascular health and provide early detection of potential issues. Additionally, the model's adaptability allows it to improve as more data becomes available, ensuring continuous enhancement of its predictive capabilities.
